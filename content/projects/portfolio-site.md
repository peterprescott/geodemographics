Part of this week's course is an [intro to Github](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/practicals/general/github/portfolio.html), which includes the task of setting up [a personal GitHub page](https://peterprescott.github.io).

But I'm vain enough to want a proper domain name for [this portfolio site](/), and I'm going to deploy it through [Netlify](https://netlify.com), which I've used a little before. It's all on GitHub though -- feel free to check out [the source code](https://github.com/peterprescott/geodemographics).
