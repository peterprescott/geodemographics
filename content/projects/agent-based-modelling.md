This project is the result of working through the practicals for [our first core module](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python-phd/), hosted by Leeds University.

You can find the source code in [my Github repository](https://github.com/peterprescott/agent-based-modelling).

I then tried [the same sort of thing in JavaScript](https://github.com/peterprescott/js-agent-modelling), so that the graphical interface could be easily displayed in a web browser:
    <center>
		<svg id="backdrop" width=500 height=500 style="border:1px solid black"></svg><br>
		<button onClick=more()>Add Agent</button>
		<button onClick=less()>Remove Agent</button>
	</center>
