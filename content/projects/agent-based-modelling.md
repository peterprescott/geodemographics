This project is the result of working through the practicals for [our first core module](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python-phd/), hosted by Leeds University.

You can find the source code in [my Github repository](https://github.com/peterprescott/agent-based-modelling).
