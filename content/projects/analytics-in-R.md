The Labour Force Survey is 'the largest household study in the UK'. As part of the Social Survey Analysis module of our [Data Analytics and Society course](https://datacdt.org/overview/), we were given a copy of the dataset from QLFS 2012 (Quarter 1), and assigned the task of inferring and describing the association between two variables of our choice. My aim in this exercise is to gain an understanding of the basic principles of statistical social analysis, to demonstrate competence in using the [free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) programming environment R, and perhaps also to make some comment on British society in the 2010s.
