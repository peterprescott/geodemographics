So [the work we've been doing this week](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python-phd/) has walked us through a variety of useful skills for data analysis using Python. But when it comes to giving the work a *Graphical User Interface*, we use TkInter. And I'd quite like to be able to display it on a web page, so that anyone anywhere (at least anyone with a internet-device somewhere with internet-access) can see the fruit of my work. So I'm trying to work out how most easily to do this. 

[Kyran Dale's book on Data Visualization with Python and Javascript](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Data-Visualization-Python-JavaScript-Transform-ebook/dp/B01HSMKJIA/) looks like it could be helpful...
