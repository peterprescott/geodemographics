## Lecturer: [Dani Arribas-Bel](https://darribas.org/)

> I am a Senior Lecturer in Geographic Data Science at the Department of Geography and Planning , and member of the Geographic Data Science Lab, at the University of Liverpool (UK), where I direct the MSc in Geographic Data Science.

## What was [Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs)?

> For a long stretch of the twentieth century, Bell Labs was the most innovative scientific organization in the world.

### R vs. Python.

> Be a ninja in one. Be able to survive in the other.

## Open Science

[Computational Notebooks, Open-Source Packages, and Reproducible Platforms](https://geographicdata.science/book/notebooks/01_geospatial_computational_environment.html):
Jupyter, Python, Docker.

## `pandas`

Developed by [Wes McKinney](https://wesmckinney.com/pages/about.html) while working for an investment management firm.

Now [an open source, BSD-licensed library](https://pandas.pydata.org/) "providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language".

> "For users of the R language for statistical computing, the DataFrame name will be familiar as the object was named after the similar R `data.frame` object."

## Reading & Manipulating Tabular Data

```{python}
import pandas

db = pandas.read_csv("...")
db.head()
db.info()
db.describe()
db.set_index("id")

db.columns()

# Columns
db["Price"].head()

#Full slice of one dimension
db.loc[0:]

# Conditional queries
db.loc[db["neighbourhood_cleansed"] == "Observatoire", 
       ["neighbourhood_cleansed", "Price"]]\
  .head()
  
db.loc[db["Price"] < 100, ["id", "neighbourhood_cleansed"]].head()

db.loc[(db["Price"] < 100) & \
       (db["bathrooms"] >= 8),
       :]
       
# Conditional filters
fltr = db["bathrooms"] > 8
fltr.head()
db[fltr]

# Concatenated queries
db.loc[(db["Price"] < 100) & \
       (db["bathrooms"] >= 8),
       :]

# Unique       
db.neighbourhood_cleansed.unique()

# New columns
db["more_beds_than_accomodates"] = db["beds"] > db["accommodates"]

```
