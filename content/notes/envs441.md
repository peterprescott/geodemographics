Social science and different kinds of research

## Research philosophy
Ontology -> Understanding of existence -> What is the nature of reality?

Epistemology -> Understanding of knowledge -> What can we know about the world?

Methodology -> System of methods -> How can we investigate the world?

> "The whole point of philosophy -- and here I reveal my own assumptions -- is that there is no one right answer..."

## Ontology
eg. The City

Objectivism: A Physical Entity: size, population, transport structure

Realism: A Socio-economic complex: patterns of employment, housing, culture

Constructivism: a set of meanings for inhabitants: a place to work, live, travel

## Epistemology 
eg. Air Pollution

Positivism: measuring sources, types, quantities etc

Realism: exposing the economic forces which lead to air pollution

Interpretivism: exploring the community perceptions of air quality

## Ethics

## Research design
- Experimental /quasi-experimental
- Cross-sectional
- Longitudinal (time)
- Case study
- Comparitive

## Case Studies: 5 misunderstandings

1. General, theoretical (context-independent) knowledge is more valuable than concrete, practical (context-dependent) knowledge.
2. One cannot generalize on the basis of an individual case; therefore the case study cannot contribute to scientific development.
3. The case study is most useful for generating hypotheses; that is, in the first stage of a total research process, whereas other methods are more suitable for hypothesis testing and theory building.
4. The case study contains a bias toward verification, that is, a tendency to confirm the researcher's preconceived notions
5. It is often difficult to summarize and develop general propositions and theories on the basis of speicif case studies.

### Sampling strategies
- Purposive
- Criterion
- Theoretical
- Convenience
- Snowball
- Maximum variation
- Extreme case
- Typical case
- Confirming and disconfirming


## Barriers to integration:
- Different audiences
- Methodological preferences
- Structure of research projects
- Role of timelines
- Skill specialisms
- Nature of the data
- Bridging ontological divides
- Publication issues
- Problem of exemplars
